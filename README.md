# LearnWise Learning Management System

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To run the development server and view the project on localhost:3000, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.js. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Configuration
Before running the project, make sure to set up your environment variables. You can do this by creating a .env file in the root directory of the project. Here are the variables you need to configure:

API_KEY: Your API key for accessing external services.
DATABASE_URL: The URL for your database.
Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual API key and database URL. Refer to the .env.example file for an example of how to structure your .env file.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
